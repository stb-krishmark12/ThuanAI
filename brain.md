### Backend
- **Server**: Next.js App Router (Server Components)
- **Authentication**: Clerk Auth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
- **Background Jobs**: Inngest

### Deployment
- Not specified in the codebase, likely Vercel or similar

## 3. Database Structure

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following models:

- **User**: Core user profile with authentication and personal information
- **Assessment**: Interview assessments with scores and feedback
- **Resume**: User resume content and ATS scores
- **CoverLetter**: Customized cover letters for job applications
- **IndustryInsight**: Industry-specific data including salary ranges and trends

## 4. User Flow

1. **Authentication**
   - Sign up/Sign in via Clerk
   - Protected routes middleware ensures authenticated access

2. **Onboarding**
   - New users must complete onboarding (selecting industry, experience level)
   - Redirected to onboarding if not completed

3. **Dashboard**
   - Main hub showing industry insights and career progress
   - Customized data based on user's industry and experience

4. **Features**
   - Resume building
   - Cover letter generation
   - Interview preparation
   - Career insights and recommendations

## 5. AI Integration

### Gemini API Integration
- Used for generating industry insights
- Provides personalized resume feedback
- Creates tailored cover letters
- Conducts mock interviews and gives feedback

### Background Processing
- Inngest handles background jobs for AI processing
- Weekly cron job updates industry insights
- Prevents blocking the main thread for long-running AI operations

## 6. Code Organization

### Directories
- **/app**: Next.js routes and pages
  - **(auth)**: Authentication-related pages
  - **(main)**: Main application pages
- **/components**: Reusable UI components
- **/lib**: Utility functions and services
- **/actions**: Server actions for data operations
- **/prisma**: Database schema and migrations
- **/hooks**: Custom React hooks

### Key Files
- **middleware.js**: Route protection and auth handling
- **schema.js**: Zod validation schemas
- **client.js/function.js**: Inngest configuration

## 7. Authentication and Authorization

- Clerk handles user authentication
- Custom middleware protects routes
- Server-side authentication checks in server actions

## 8. Data Flow

1. **UI Components** → Send data through forms
2. **Server Actions** → Process data and update database
3. **Database** → Stores user and application data
4. **AI Integration** → Processes requests and generates insights
5. **Background Jobs** → Handle long-running tasks

## 9. Strengths

- Modern tech stack with Next.js App Router
- AI integration for personalized advice
- Background job processing for performance
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Typescript for type safety

## 10. Improvement Areas

- Error handling could be more robust
- Limited test coverage visible
- Some potential race conditions in data operations
- More comprehensive logging might be beneficial

## 11. Conclusion

The AI Career Coach represents a well-structured modern web application that effectively combines AI capabilities with a user-friendly interface. The architecture follows best practices for Next.js applications with clean separation between UI components, server-side logic, and data access. The use of background jobs for AI processing ensures good performance.
